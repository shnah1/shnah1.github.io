I am an economist working for the Bank of Korea which is the central bank of South Korea. 
I attended Seoul National University and got a bachelor degree from Business Administraion in 1995. During undergraduate, I was interested in economics while studying accounting or finance. This led me to decide to get a job related to economic research. I joined  the Bank of Korea and started my career in 1996.
In 2004, I was selected as a trainee of the Bank's Foreign Academic Program and got a Phd in Economics at the Ohio State University in 2010. After graduation, I came back to the BOK and have been working in Research Department, Economic Research Institute, and Office of Sustainable Growth.
